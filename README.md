Source code for the T-Level Digital Production, Design and Development Exam 2024.

This is where you can view the source code for the project. This was developed over a 30-hour period split across 4 weeks. 
Some features went unfinished such as the Loyalty Point scheme due to time constraints. 

During this 4 week period, we had to have our exams rescheduled at least 4 times, with them being cancelled entirely on multiple occasions. 
We had 3 student's work lost completely, with me initially being included but luckily mine was recovered. 
All of these factors contributed to the lack of a finished product.
